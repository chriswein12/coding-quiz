# JavaScript Coding Quiz

## Description of the Website
This is a website that offers a 5-question quiz about JavaScript fundamentals. It utilizes JavaScript to present questions with multiple choice answers, and give the player a final score at the end if they win.

<br/>

## How it Works
* Simply click on the button that says "Click to Start!" The game and timer will then begin. If the player choose the correct answer you will go to the next question. However, if they choose incorrectly, 15 seconds will be removed from the clock before going to the next question. The player wins if they answer all 5 questions before time runs out. If the player wins, they will be presented with a form to log their score.

<br/>

## Website Features
* A 75-second timer that starts when the game starts.
* A High Score section that shows all of the player's scores and initials from local storage.
* Checks to make sure that the player doesn't leave the submit form blank, or try to enter in more than 3 characters as initials.
* Different end screens based on whether the player won or lost.
